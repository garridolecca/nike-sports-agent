## 2026-03-01 - [Caching Mutable DataFrames]
**Learning:** When caching mutable objects like Pandas DataFrames using `@lru_cache` in a web context, you must return a `.copy()` to prevent state mutation bugs across different API requests. A direct return from the cache will allow concurrent or subsequent requests to modify the underlying data if they do inplace changes.
**Action:** Always return `.copy()` or `[dict(d) for d in cached_list]` when caching mutable structures to optimize repeated reads safely without risking shared state mutation.
